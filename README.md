## Overview
The Loan Approval Prediction project aims to streamline the loan approval process by automating the prediction of loan eligibility. By analyzing historical loan data, we can make informed predictions that help financial institutions make faster and more accurate decisions. This solution leverages both data science and machine learning methodologies.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw data for training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts useful features to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains multiple models and evaluates performance.
- **Deployment Ready**: Includes scripts and configuration files for deployment on cloud platforms like AWS and optional GCP.
